I'm a fan of [MathJax](http://mathjax.org), it is no secret. Anything that lets me write content without having to worry about markup has three thumbs up, so a library that lets you write maths in "plain" LaTeX format and takes care of the tedious typesetting is excellent! I make heavy use of it in my [article on Bezier curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo), in fact.

But my blog didn't have it built in yet, and now it does. That means I can rant about things that might involve a formula or two (or three, or more), without having to worry about adding in images that lock content away in pixels. So, have a Bezier curve function:

`\[ B_n(t) = \\sum^n_{k=0}{ \\binom{n}{k} t^k (1-t)^{n-k}} \]`

And I'll see you next post.
