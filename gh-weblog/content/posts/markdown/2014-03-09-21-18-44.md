I've been recently working on [a glyphlet font generator](http://pomax.github.io/CFF-glyphlet-fonts) that you can use to create on-page fonts for single glyphs. At 17kb gzipped, it's a smaller library than any webfont you'll find, and it'll let you specify your character outline as SVG and then magic happens, it's now a font.

However, while writing it, it has become more of an excursion into how OpenType fonts work, and what you need to look out for when you want to implement one.  Yes, there are things like FontForge or TTX that will generate you a font, but I like to think that in order to really understand a thing, you have to make it. You're not going to understand your car's engine until you've taken it apart and put it back together again, and you're not really going to understand OpenType fonts until you've tried to actually make one. Not "design a typeface", but "actually craft an OpenType font".

Of course there is a certain irony is me telling you that you won't understand something unless you do it yourself, then present you with the work you'd end up doing, but see this as a shortcut to understanding: I still encourage you to get down and dirty, but you can use my field notes as a guide while the dirt accumulates.  OpenType fonts are ridiculously powerful things. Explore that power.
