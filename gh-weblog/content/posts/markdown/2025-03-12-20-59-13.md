I'm currently in the process of writing a tutorial on how to implement a multiplayer version of "real" [mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong) (the four player draw-one, play-one game), and while it feels like I'm nearing completion, I started this before Christmas and if you're familiar with [my other writing](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo) then [you might understand](https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying) why it's taken so long..

This tutorial covers:

- RPC-over-websockets without ever writing RPC or websocket code
- implementing the mahjong game loop
- implementing game clients using custom HTML elements
- implementing bots
- implementing different "flavours" of mahjong
- implementing a lobby system
- implementing the stupid "solitaire" game "because why not"

And so it's really more of a full project book than a tutorial: we're currently sitting at about 75 thousand words (including code snippets) with everything but the last two parts covered, so hopefully I can publish this soon and get back to _playing_ mahjong in stead =)
