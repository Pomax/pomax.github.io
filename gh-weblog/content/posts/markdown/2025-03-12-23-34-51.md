I recently got an exciting email from Adobe about an upcoming change to my subscription. Namely that they were nearly doubling the price, and combined with all the other nonsense they've been pulling over the last few years that was the final push I needed to just cancel my membership.

And that sucks, because to this day no one's made a decent alternative to Lightroom, but I'll cope. So far, here's what I'm using instead:

- [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ca/products/davinciresolve) instead of Premiere/After Effects. "It's free!" except I don't use the free version, I own the Studio version and have been using it in parallel with After Effects for years now. I guess I get to learn Fusion properly now though, because I'm never touching Adobe's video editing ever again.
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) and [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) instead of Photoshop. And let's be honest, Gimp is still stuck in 1992 so most of the time it's going to be Krita, even though that was designed to be more of an art production application. Gimp is a fallback, at best. It's amazing how long it's been around without actually moving with the times and the needs of folks who want off the Adobe merry-go-round.
- I'm looking at replacing Lightroom with [DxO](https://www.dxo.com) now that that finally supports collections and keywords, but I'm going to have to do some digging to see if I can write a lightroom catalogue conversion script or not. If I can't, then I might end up having to buy a sailboat just so I can keep working with my catalogue files (which are just sqlite3 databases).

"What about audio?"

I never used Audition, mostly because I own so much audio software that Adobe can't possibly have something to offer that I don't already have much better software for. At least the audio world never had to suffer Adobe lock-in.

Anyway, we'll see how it goes. Goodbye forever, Adobe, I've been a paying customer since the Photoshop CS3 days (not CC, CS) but at this point there's just nothing you can do that will make me every pay you for anything again. Short of going back to offering people permanent licenses for your software of course. You're why everyone else is now doing software rental too, and you know it, and you made the world worse.
