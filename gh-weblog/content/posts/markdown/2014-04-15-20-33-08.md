Before heading off for a week of vacation in North California I wanted to get some small things out of the way, one of them being Thimble's crowded tool bar. The issue was relatively clear cut: ["There are too many things to fit in the bar, we need to move some of those things into a settings menu or something"](https://github.com/mozilla/thimble.webmaker.org/pull/411). So I did, and it works just fine, and it looks much better, but the thing that keeps striking me the most when I work on issues like these is that it's not that much work, but the usability improvements are profound. The peace of mind a simple relocation buys you cannot be measured in lines of code or tickets closed: it turns an eyesore into a clean bit of tooling that no longer bothers people.

They're honestly some of my favourite bugs.
