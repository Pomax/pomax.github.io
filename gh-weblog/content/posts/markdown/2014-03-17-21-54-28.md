I was reading up on how the universe works (at the macroscopic level) and ran across a diagram of what the passing of Mars in the night sky looks like over time, with a "quirk" that makes it look like Mars moves backwards for a little bit, before going forward again.

The reason is pretty simple, and has to do with the Earth and Mars having different orbits, leading to Mars being projected onto the night sky in a particular way.  [Hyper physics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/retromars.html) has a nice description of this on their site (with pictures!).

I like these kind of quirks, so I whipped up a little [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch that models arbitrary arc-projections, with keyboard interactivitity, to demonstrate what happens when you look at a body moving along an arc path, while moving along an arc path yourself, too. Head over to [this jsbin](http://jsbin.com/gurasuve/2) to play with it.
