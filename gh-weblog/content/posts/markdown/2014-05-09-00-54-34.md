I've been meaning to update this blog thing with the ability to drap-and-drop an image file from "the OS" onto an entry and have it automatically upload that to github so I can link to it as a relative link and simply not have to care about "content management" and "image locations" and all that nonsense...  so today I did!

It works quite well on this particular instance, so the trick now is to make sure to backport it to the [blog repo proper](https://github.com/pomax/gh-blog) so that everyone else can enjoy the same handiness. Which mostly leaves sorting out partial content loading (so you can browser a few entries at a time instead of 120 entries on the same page) and RSS generation (it's somehow putting entries in the wrong places depending on whether it was an existing entry or a new one... very odd).

Anyway, good times, more blogging for me.
