Ever had MacOS not correctly unmount your external drive and then it remounts it and now even though the icon on your desktop says "SomeVolume" the actual location in the `/Volumes` list is `SomeVolume 1` and there's an orphaned "SomeVolume" that doesn't actually work or point to anything?

Maddening. Eject your external drive from the desktop, then open a terminal and `cd /Volumes`, followed by an `ls -l` to confirm there is no entry for it on its "... 1" name anymore. Then disconnect the drive from your machine.

Run a `sudo rm -rf SomeVolume` to clean up the orphaned volume mount that's pointing to literally nothing, and wait for that finish (this is rather important. Wait for it to finish. Under no circumstances should you proceed with the next step until then).

Plug your external drive back in. Congrats, it now has its proper volume binding again.
