I'm working on a [cursive, swashed typeface](https://github.com/pomax/Cursive-swash-typeface/), and have been looking for tools that let me turn pages and pages of written letters into at least basic visualisable type.

Turns out that the tool I was looking for is [High-Logic's FontCreator](http://www.high-logic.com/font-editor/fontcreator.html). Their auto-tracer is really nice, and kicks in when you paste in a bitmap from something like Photoshop, so my prototyping workflow right now is "write the hell out of this typeface", scan it at a high dpi, then find a decent looking glyph representative, isolate it and paste it over. That's... well, pretty much it.

That means that I've been able to go from this:

<img src="/images/sheet.jpg" alt="a sheet of letters">

to this:

<img src="/images/prototype-font.jpg" alt="a functioning font based on the sheet">

in about an hour. That's a [picture of a webpage](http://pomax.github.io/Cursive-swash-typeface), by the way. Yeah, webfonts are the best thing since "system fonts".

Obviously this is literally quick and dirty prototyping, but FontCreator is a normal font editor, with normal vector editing, so after prototyping I can start the refining processing, or if I need even more control, the data can be loaded into literally any other decent font editor, like [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io) or [Fontlab Studio](http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio).

I'm seriously looking forward to prototyping the hell out of my designs with this!
