In a [previous post](#gh-weblog-1395439049236) I mentioned we were adding a proxy service to thimble, so that you could use http resources on our https service, without everything breaking. As of this moment, that is live on [thimble.webmaker.org](https://thimble.webmaker.org), so you should no longer be creatively stifled just because you found and used a google image result as a CSS background.

Now, there are limitataions, as mentioned before, but because you may not want to read a second post, here's the recap:

- You can use whatever images you want inside a `<style>` block!
- You can use whatever JavaScript library you want to use in a `<script src="...">` call! (although because it's JavaScript, *make sure you are at least confident it's the official release*, and not a random file that claims to be the library you want on a random website).
- If you have the option, use ["//www.example.org/images/thatImageIWanted.jpg"](http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/) instead of adding an "http://" or "https://" in front of it. This notation makes the browser look for the same protocol that the loading website is using, and is always mixed-content-safe. This works for Flickr and Google resources, for instance, although it might not work for everything.
- When linking to external CSS files, be aware that we might not be able to proxy everything. We will certainly be able to proxy the .css file itself, but anything it links to further, we won't be able to detect (... for now?)

Remix all the things!
