It's that time again, when the Mozilla Foundation descents on a Moz Office, stronger each year, and spends a week coordinating, brain storming, caffinating, and generally coming up with the plan for the next year, not just in terms of vapid blue sky thinking ideas, but concrete steps that we can make things with.

On the tools side, we've shuffled some things around so that Webmaker.org now consists of a platform team, and a tools team rather than a general purpose dev team. It should be interesting to see what we do with this new division; the first thing to concrete come rolling out of this is moving Appmaker closer to webmaker, starting with a spot on the webmaker.org site, and hopefully ending with Appmaker as a new tool for you to play with.

More to come, because it's still early on a Monday, but this week is going to be good.
